# msc

This is my first attempt to make a serious repo after
a few trials and 'hello-world'

I am keeping my solutions to the assignments we get for
programming classes in my PG mathematics course.

## I am very new to this git thing and I'm not a pro programmer

## I am however a curious guy who likes to learn
